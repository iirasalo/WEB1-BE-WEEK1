## Tasks

> Work in group to solve these tasks.

## Task 1

- Difference between [V8](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) and [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey)
--> V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.
--> SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's JavaScript and WebAssembly Engine, used in Firefox, Servo and various other projects. It is written in C++, Rust and JavaScript.

- Difference between [V8](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) and [Blink](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)>)
--> Blink is Google Chrome's rendering engine (browser engine), V8 is the JavaScript Engine used within Blink, and Chromium is the browser project that holds them all together.

## Task 2

The function `min(a,b)` in `script.js` should return the least of two numbers a and b. For instance:

```js
min(2, 5); // returns 2
min(3, -1); // returns-1
min(1, 1); // returns 1
```

- Fix the code

## Task 3

The node command is the one we use to run our Node.js scripts:

```bash
node script.js
```

If we run the node command without any script to execute or without any arguments, we start a REPL session:

```bash
node
```

- Use REPL to calculate `(413/2)+(14\*6)`

## Task 4

Create a folder `task4`. In the folder create file `script.js` that logs `This is JavaScript` to console, and run it.
