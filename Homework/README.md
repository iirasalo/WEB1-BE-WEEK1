## Part 2/5

- What is the difference between frontend developers and backend developers?
Front end developers design visual aspects (UI/UX --> e.g. layouts, user interactions and navigation related aspects) of websites and applications (with e.g. JavaScript, HTML and CSS) whilst back end developers design the invisible functional server (e.g. SQL) side parts of them making the front end part work (with e.g. Java, Python and Ruby).

- State some character trait you possess that help your career.
I shine in creative work, design and in having a very strong motivation to do proper work and learn new. Mathematical/logical thinking (study background in mathematics) combined with mediocre programming skills are an advantage. I have 12 years of experience working as specialized dental nurse in healthcare internationally (advanced work, such as high aseptics surgical procedures, complicated parodontical procedures independedntly and independent orthodontic work - including practice management experience and web admin work). Overall soft skills and team leading skills are part of my expertise due to previous work experience. I have a tendency to be positive, help others and use humour as a motivational tool within different teams and projects.

- How can you keep up with technology trends? is it easy to stay up-to-date with new technologies?
I keep my eyes open especially in regards of dental and imaging (x-ray tech) technology by following a variety of companies (e.g. newsletters and webinars). Metropolia's news site updated by teachers has turned out to be a great tool to obtain more information about newest trends and news. I should widen my horizon a bit more outside of dental field, to be honest. 
          Staying up-to-date with ALL new technologies is challenging due to the ENORMOUS amount of new information available every moment. Limiting my interests to dental and imaging tech has been a must.

## Part 3/5

- What are the benefits of pair programming? Refer to the Links below.
Programming in pairs gives a chance to evaluate other's code in real time making it more efficient to share the best practices and comment on errors (knowledge sharing, reflection, different ideas and stretegies --> effectiveness). Many pair programming techniques are available online. Consistent quality and maintainability in long term. Programming in pairs requires the members to justify and explain WHY something is done the way it is. Collective code-ownership, higher focus and continuous integration, immediate feedback.

- What are the advantages of team based learning? Refer to the Links below.
Team based learning makes it possible to harvest thoughts, ideas and knowledge from other student to be able to reach best learning outcomes and answers to challenging topics together. It also develops students' skills in raising questions and comments and/or challenge other members' or teams' answers on a variety of topics.
